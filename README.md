# ycardsmarketfrontend

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Headed Component Tests with [Cypress Component Testing](https://on.cypress.io/component)

```sh
npm run test:unit:dev # or `npm run test:unit` for headless testing
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```

# YCardsMarket

Experienced in managing and trading card collections. Skilled in organizing personal collections, building strategic decks, and facilitating card trades via live chat to coordinate shipping details. Adept at maintaining wish lists to target card acquisitions effectively.

## Features

- **Wish List**: A list of cards the user hopes to acquire.
- **Personal Collection**: The user can manage their collection, specifying the number and types of cards they possess.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into four main folders:

- **`/front`**: Contains the Vuejs frontend application, offering a responsive and intuitive user interface.
- **`/back`**: Houses the Django backend application, responsible for secure data handling and business logic.
- **`/deploy`**: Includes scripts, Docker-compose files, and other necessary tools for deploying the application.
- **`/docs`**: Contains global documentation of the project, including setup guides, usage instructions, and development practices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker-compose
- Node.js 20.12.3 and npm (for frontend development)
- Python 3 (for backend development)

### Setup and Installation

If you're planning to run this project in a production environment, I can't stress enough how **important it is to change the default passwords** we've set up for development or testing. Don't worry, though â€“ we'll have a guide for setting up everything for production ready pretty soon to help you out.
